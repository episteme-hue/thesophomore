				The etymology of <em>sophomore</em> is interesting and apt for an undergraduate philosophy magazine. Combining the Greek words <em>sophistēs</em> (meaning wisdom) and <em>mōros</em> (meaning foolish), we are left with a word that describes a wise fool. It describes the transition from being foolish to wanting to be wise, precisely the aim of every undergraduate student. As an undergraduate philosophy magazine, it shows a thirst for knowledge while being open to engagement, open to be corrected, open to appear foolish in order to become wise. Afterall, as an undergraduate magazine, we are still only <em>sophomores.</em>

				An on-campus, bi-annual philosophy magazine would allow for substantive popular engagement with philosophy on Denison’s campus, increase Episteme’s visibility, create interorganizational connections, and encourage philosophical thinking and discussion (as is concomitant with Denison’s institutional mission).
