## §1. Introduction

Jane Austen writes, “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.” [(Austen, 1894)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1081602x.2021.1897028) A similar truth might be observed about Victorian society and that is Man’s want of an animal. Animal-human relationships permeate Victorian narratives of identity and social standing. So much so that in reminiscences following Queen Victoria’s death—descriptions that symbolically capture the essence of her era—her fondness for donkeys was important enough to warrant mention in her legacy.[ii]

Through an analysis of articles and illustrations depicting animals—primarily donkeys and mules—published in the Illustrated London News, I argue that narratives about animals and animal-human relations only reinforced class prejudices in Victorian England. Historians, Harriet Ritvo and Julie-Marie Strange have established how relationships between humans and animals represented, explained, and justified the Victorian social order. Extending Ritvo’s scholarship in “The Animal Estate,”[iii] this paper examines how and why animals and the narratives surrounding them served as proxies for human social hierarchies. I then demonstrate—through Strange’s paper, “When John met Benny”[iv]—how these narratives were shaped by economic constraints. I conclude that this interplay between material conditions and narratives about animal-human relations perpetuates class prejudices in Victorian society.

## §2. The Animal Metaphor  

In “The Animal Estate,” Harriet Ritvo observes that “the earliest recorded laws in Britain implicitly invested animals with human rights and responsibilities.”[v] Animals were seen as morally accountable agents, who could testify in court and hanged for (what are now seen as) human crimes. Towards the 19th Century, English law had changed. As Man advanced in their subordination of nature, the separation between humans and animals ensued. From being similar subjects in the eyes of the law, animals had now become the property of Man.[vi] This shift in relation between animals and humans converted animals as significant objects of human manipulation—not only for their material use, but also as sites of discourse.[vii]

Discourse about animals “expressed many human concerns linked only tenuously to the natural world.”[viii] Such expressions, Ritvo notes, “represent a widespread rhetorical practice, which the Victorians exploited with special vigor.”[ix] Because animals had been deeply integrated into many facets of English life, interactions with them often reflected traditional understandings and deeply held convictions, especially about class.[x] As Ritvo explains, “the power of discourse lies in its inevitable restructuring and re-creation of reality.”[xi] What makes animals an important site for the ordering of Victorian society is their inability to protest against the discourse that shapes the reality about them. Depictions of class can then come through associations with specific animals and how one is associated with them. This class-determining/determined site can be observed in articles published in the Illustrated London News.

## §3. What are men to donkeys and mules?

In August 1874, a mule and donkey show was organized in Islington.[xii] Its promoters included prominent figures such as Albert Edward VII—the Prince of Wales. The show was intended to improve the treatment and condition of “that much-abused beast of burden, which is too commonly found in the possession of cruel or careless owners among a portion of the working-class.”[xiii] There were two divisions exhibiting donkeys. One division showcased the “aristocratic ass,”[xiv] judged on the basis of their aesthetic appeal—won by the prince’s donkey. The other division exhibited those donkeys that were “used by owners in their business,”[xv] which awarded prize money to owners of the best kempt for donkeys.

This distinction between the “aristocratic ass” and the working-class donkey underscores how animals functioned as proxies for social hierarchies in Victorian England. The nobility’s donkeys were judged on aesthetics—a reflection of leisure and refinement—while the working-class donkeys were evaluated on utility and upkeep. Such distinctions in categories reflected the respective class identity of the show’s participants. Furthermore, the nobility’s role in advocating for better treatment of these animals reinforces their perceived moral and social superiority, positioning them as arbiters of both human and animal welfare. Such a site implies that there is an opportunity to challenge one’s class identity through the refinement of a worker’s treatment of donkeys.

However, the worker-donkey relationship, and the respective narrative that shapes the working-class identity is to some extent determined. In the paper, “When John met Benny,”[xvi] by Julie-Marie Strange, she observes that “economic cost and the availability of space shaped who had access to pet keeping, which species were viable to keep, and the material context in which embodied encounters between human and animal family members took place.”[xvii] While she discusses animals that are predominantly treated as pets, the same dynamic occurs for working animals. One’s material conditions directly influenced the narratives constructed around donkeys and how they were perceived in Victorian society. For the working-class, donkeys represented economic necessities that could perform crucial labor. Such conditions shaped how these animals were characterized: as “beasts of burden” whose utility value overshadowed aesthetic considerations. Meanwhile, aristocratic donkeys could be kept purely for leisure and judged primarily on their beauty, a luxury that working-class families could not afford. The donkey-show, thus, reified these distinctions by creating separate competitive categories that tacitly acknowledged the class-determined purposes of animal ownership.

In 1874, another article describes a “great ass interest,”[xviii] attended by wealthy agriculturalists, members of the nobility, and the more humble working-class populace. Costermongers[xix] brought their animal companions to the mule and donkey show at the Crystal Palace. The author sarcastically remarks that in such a setting, one might be “as proud to call himself an honorary costermonger as to be a Knight of the Garter,”[xx] adding that “whatever we say of him, we may surely say of his ass.”[xxi] This comparison highlights how donkeys serve as direct extensions of their working-class owners—their status and treatment reflecting and reinforcing the status of those who own them. In suggesting an elevation of status, it is implied that such classes of animals and people were inferior in the first place. Furthermore, the author’s sarcastic comparison between a costermonger and a Knight of the Garter also deliberately juxtaposes two extremes of the Victorian social hierarchy—a street-vendor against a recipient of England’s most prestigious order of chivalry—thereby mocking the very notion that a working-class tradesman could achieve a comparable status through the performance of their donkeys at a donkey show.

With a shift in tone, the article remarks on the virtues of the donkey as “beasts of service,”[xxii] suggesting that prejudices against them are misplaced. In elevating the donkey, it ridicules humans. The irony being that people are ridiculed as being inferior or equals to donkeys—the perpetual “soon-to-be” metaphor for virtue. This narrative constraint emerges directly from economic conditions that shape worker-donkey dynamics. Their value, defined primarily through their capacity to work for an owner, mirrors the position of their working-class keepers who are subordinate to the owning classes. Thus, the economic structure of Victorian society not only determined material relationships between humans and animals but also constrained the animal-human narratives that mold classes in relation to each other.

The article “Queen Victoria’s Donkey”[xxiii] may be an instance that challenges these narrative constraints, providing for an opportunity to interrupt class prejudices. In memoriam of Queen Victoria, the article speaks on her fondness for donkeys. It discusses how this fondness was often featured in the news, “devoted to the inculcation of kindness to dumb animals.”[xxiv] Favoured for their loyalty to the Queen, her donkeys are thus remembered alongside the Empress of India. By their association with the late monarch, the donkey-worker relation is delinked and what emerges is a narrative about donkeys that associate the animal with Queen Victoria.

One might argue that this association between Queen Victoria and her donkeys could disrupt class prejudices by elevating the status of those who worked closely with these animals. However, this narrative is only invoked when the human counterpart is the Queen. Her donkeys occupied a unique role—unlike a costermonger’s donkey, which carted goods through the streets, the Queen’s donkeys were the humble creatures that pulled the Queen’s carriage. In this context, the donkey becomes a reflection of the Queen’s magnanimity rather than a mere beast of burden. Yet, this elevation does not extend to the working-class donkey owner. While the Queen’s association with donkeys imbues them with dignity, the worker’s relationship with their donkey merely reinforces their existing class identity. The narrative surrounding the Queen’s donkeys thus serves to distinguish her benevolence rather than challenge the broader social hierarchy that continues to define working-class individuals through their animals.

## §4. Conclusion

As explored through articles in the Illustrated London News, Victorian society’s treatment of animals—particularly donkeys—both reflected and reinforced class distinctions, shaping narratives that upheld the existing social hierarchy. The divide between the aristocratic and working-class donkey mirrored broader class structures, where the nobility’s animals were symbols of refinement, while working-class donkeys remained bound to their economic function. The case of Queen Victoria’s donkeys momentarily disrupted these constrained narratives, offering an alternative association of donkeys with aristocratic virtue and identity. However, this exception was tied exclusively to the Queen’s status, failing to extend to the working-class whose donkeys remained burdened with the same connotations of labor and subservience. The economic constraints that defined human-animal relationships ensured that working-class individuals could not elevate their status through their treatment of animals in the same way the nobility could. While donkeys were praised for their loyalty, resilience, and service, these very qualities were used to relegate them—and by extension, their owners—to a fixed place in the class structure. Far from challenging social prejudices, the discourse around animals helped to naturalize them, demonstrating that even in Victorian society’s regard for its beasts of burden, class remained an inescapable determinant of value and identity.
